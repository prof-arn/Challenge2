## **THE INTRODUCTION:** 
this is a code for a conway's game of life inspiered challenge by the 2025 InfoBrains JS Bootcamp specifacally the second challenge, in this readme file I'll briefly go through the process of writing my code.
### **1-The Beggining:**
At the very beginning I started by copying the pre-made code onto my code editor, Then I started studying it and found out about the missing implentations of the drawpulsar function and the drawpentadechalon function and also the naming mistake ine the pentadechalon button function so I started by finishing them and fixing the code

after all that I started with implementing extra functions for the sake of makeing the project more lively and that how we get to the next process
#### **2-The "Creative" implementations:**
In this part of the process I had to come up with ideas to make the project look more unique and stand out from the other participants projects, So I started imlementing as many functions and options as I can ,From the most basic to the most complex I can make,And it went somewhat like this:
>- I started by making a speed adjustment slider as it was the easiest thing I could do
>- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb88aca9-502c-45b5-a2df-960369453e4a)
>- then I made the code for a timer
>- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe893f21-3543-4e35-9496-a2b2078ddd4e)
>- Then I made a text to show that I made the project
>- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65a98a8d-9c73-480e-9552-0088bc2460b9)
>- After that I made multiple game modes and buttons on the main page that link to said game modes, for example I'm showing the battle button code
>- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67b67c2f-db44-4448-83f8-03ac992d0d0b)
>- [the reason I made the game modes standalone instead of integrated is because I kept running into errors wich made the original buttons(glidergun,pulsar...ext)non functional)
>- And at last, I made an animation for the buttons to make the web page more lively

now for the next and final step
##### **3-The devil in the details:**
>If you have been paying attention you may have realized I have yet to talk about the coloring and styling and UI in general,you may even ask why did I not talk about it in the beginning or before talking about the buttons and the functions?
>The reason is simple really,**EVERY TIME I EVEN COME NEAR THE COLOR SCHEME OR THE OVERALL UI ELEMENTS OF THE ORIGINAL index.html FILE EVERYTHING STOPS WORKING AND IT WON'T WORK EVEN IF I REVERT TO A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE FILE WICH MEANS, I HAVE TO REMAKE EVERYTHING AND I MEAN EVERYTHING ALL THE WAY FROM THE GROUND UP TO BEFORE I TOUCHED THE UI SO I CAN TRY CHANGE IT AGAIN, AND IT ALL HAPPENED 32 TIMES,32**.
>Thankfully, And I don't know why, On the 33rd attempt for some reason I was able to change the color scheme slightily and that is when I stopped and considered myself done because even if it doesn't look good I'm not willing to risk wasting more hours of my life, thank you.
# **The conclusion:**
This is only the second challenge in the bootcamp and I already hate Frontend programming.
